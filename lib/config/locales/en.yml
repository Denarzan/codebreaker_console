    run: "Hello Stranger! Codebreaker is a logic game in which you need to break a secret code created by a code-maker.
\nYou get some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).\n
In each turn make a guess of 4 numbers.\n
The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces."
    start: "You have 4 options to write: start, rules, stats, exit."
    exit: "Goodbye!"
    name: "Write your name!"
    code: "Write secret code!"
    difficulties: "Choose one of three difficulties:
Easy - 15 attempts. 2 hints
Medium - 10 attempts. 1 hint
Hell - 5 attempts. 1 hint
Write what you want"
    rules: "The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).\n
In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.\n
The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.\n
A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers\n
in the secret code and in the same position. For example:\n

Secret number - 1234\n
Input number - 6264\n

Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers\n
 in the secret code but in a different position. For example:\n

Secret number - 1234\n
Input number - 6462\n

Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.\n
If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.\n
Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).\n
If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code."
    stats:
      empty: "No any stats yet. File is empty."

  error:
    command: "Unexpected message. Please, try again!"

    code: "Your code is invalid. You can write exit, hint, rules or your code one more time!"

    hints: "You use all of your hints("
    new: "Write 'yes' or 'no', please."
    win: "You win! The right answer is %{code}! Would you like to save the game to the stats?\n
Enter 'save' if you want, 'exit' if you want to end the game and 'start' if you want to start a new game!"
    lose: Youve already used all of your attempts. Unfortunately, you lose. The correct answer is %{code}.
    start: "Would you like to begin new game? Write 'yes' or 'no'!"
